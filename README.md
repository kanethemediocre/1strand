# 1strand
So there's a lot of debugging stuff that works fine currently commented out. Printing coordinates in various formats mostly.  I don't know if it's helpful.

1strand currently generates move and extrude instructions for a single rectangular perimeter.  The last instruction is inserted in the front of the output for reasons I do not understand.  There is no setup or homing instructions included in the output at this time.
